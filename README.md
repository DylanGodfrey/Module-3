# Module 3 Challenge

## Description

The motivation of this project was to take an existing website and refactor its code to prompt the user for constraints on character sets and then use thsoe to generate a password. I learned how to take user input from prompts and use them together to generate a secure password.

## Installation

To install, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/DylanGodfrey/Password-Generator
```

## Usage

Clicking the "Generate Password" button will prompt the user to enter "true" or "false" into prompt windows and use those to generate a password.
